# analyzing_podcast_rssfeed
1. The overall goal of the project was to analyze the episode descriptions from the history podcast “Stuff You Missed in History Class”. 
2. I wanted to answer the following questions:
      * How many of the episodes focus on 
            1. Western vs Non-western history? 
            2. Female vs Male history? 
            3. White people, minorities/people of color, and LGBTQ? 
3. I chose this project because I love podcasts and learning. I also wanted to find a way to help one of my favorite podcasts in improving representation among their episodes, and, thus increase their number of listeners. 
4. So, when I have completed this project, my intention is to send the results to the podcast hosts, so they can have a better picture of where there is a dearth in representation in their show.
